This is a journaling file manager.  The current implementation is
quick and dirty, but it works.

Why?
====

As part of my backup processes, I lime like to be able to have a nice
human-readable text journal of the files I've changed, moved around,
or deleted.  The problem, though, is that the default tools available
in operating systems are not as good as this as they probably could or
should be, and although there are some nice to use methods, they are
nonstandard and specific to particular operating systems.  Why not
just be able to get the relevant data directly from the user-mode
software that you are using?  That way, you can get the needed
information even if you are running atop a proprietary operating
system, so long as your user-mode software is libre.

Originally, I created a set of patches against PCManFM, but I figured
writing my own independent file manager would be a better long-term
solution.  So I started writing this one, `jfman`.

As for PCManFM, chances are that I could get the patches in to
upstream... Hon Jen Yee seems to be a pretty cooperative fellow.
